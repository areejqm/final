Subject to Section 22 below, you agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within New York County in the State of New York. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the sale of products and/or services on or through the Sites concluded with consumers in Québec will be governed by the laws of the Province of Québec and the laws of Canada applicable therein, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any cause of action arising thereunder shall be commenced and be heard in the appropriate court in the Province of Québec, and you agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of courts located within the District of Montréal in the Province of Québec for such matter. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms shall remain in full force and effect. All provisions of these Terms that consist of or relate to notices, ownership of intellectual or other property, representations, warranties, limitations of liability, disclaimers, indemnification, governing law, venue or jurisdiction, or any prohibitions or restrictions respecting any access to, use of, or other activities concerning the Sites or any Site Content, shall survive the revocation, expiration or termination, in whole or in part, of these Terms. We reserve all rights not expressly granted in these Terms. The parties have expressly requested and required that these Terms and all other related documents be drawn up in the English language. Les parties conviennent et exigent expressément que ces modalités et tous les documents qui s’y rapportent soient rédigés en anglais.</p>

Notices of Claimed Copyright Infringement. We respect the intellectual property rights of others, and require that users of the Sites do the same.

22. Disputes You agree that any dispute or claim arising out of your use of the Sites or any products sold on the Sites, including any dispute or claim as to the application, enforceability, scope, or interpretation of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to these Terms of Use.</p>
<p>
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.  However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief, or statutory damages), and must follow these Terms of Use.</p>

Arbitration shall be administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”), pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures effective July 1, 2014, and conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Arbitration shall take place by phone, unless an in-person hearing is requested by either party. In that case, the hearing shall take place in the county where you reside.  To the extent this agreement to arbitrate conflicts with the JAMS Policy on Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness (the “Minimum Standards”), the Minimum Standards in that regard will apply. Disputes may also be referred to another arbitration organization if you and the Company agree in writing, or to an arbitrator appointed pursuant to Section 5 of the Federal Arbitration Act. To start an arbitration proceeding, you must execute and serve a Demand for Arbitration on the Company by mailing it to insert address pursuant to the JAMS instructions. The Company will bear the reasonable cost of your initial filing fee.<br>


We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each expressly waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
